# alt:V - Open Roleplay

Remember to ðŸŒŸ this Github if you ðŸ’– it.

---

Open Roleplay is a base gamemode for Roleplay servers. It will include the ideal functionality to get the base ground work for a roleplay gamemode started. **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT COMPLETE IN ANY WAY.**

I will not be providing direct support for this gamemode; if you have an issue or come across actual functionality issues please raise an issue in the **issues** tab.

**Installation:**

The file structure below is the **IDEAL** and **required** structure you must use for this game mode.
You must follow it exactly.

You're going to need these additional repositories:

-   [Chat-Extended for 'chat'](https://github.com/team-stuyk-alt-v/altV-Chat-Extended)
-   [Postgres-Wrapper](https://github.com/team-stuyk-alt-v/altV-Postgres-Wrapper)

You're going to need to install a base version of [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

```yaml
altVServerFolder/
â””â”€â”€ resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ chat/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ index.mjs
|   â”œâ”€â”€ client.mjs
|   â”œâ”€â”€ resource.cfg

|   â”œâ”€â”€ client.mjs

**Important** You can configure your database connection inside of:

```
Change the 'text' inside of SQL(<here>)
