Open Roleplay is a base gamemode for Roleplay servers.
Open Roleplay is the base framework for my server: [alt:V Life](https://discord.gg/fc7P9eH).
Open Roleplay has its own [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/WbzTJXW).

### Licensing

If you'd like to remove the splash screens at any point; we can negotiate at a price. However, you will be responsible for removing them and not me. Otherwise, just leave the splash screens alone. This is a free framework and the least you can do is give credit. You are also required to put **ORP** in your gamemode for your alt:V server configuration. You did not write this gamemode; and it is not your **custom gamemode**. **Put credit where credit is due.**

### Feature List and Roadmap

You can find a full list of features and the roadmap [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19f9xTn6m3qVfUZYV6cQ8dMstLLdfYC2BavTV7YpzfLc/).

**IMPORTANT** If you are not a developer; this may not be the project for you. There is some general configuration that needs to be done and understanding code is important.

I **will not** be providing direct support for this gamemode; if you have an issue or come across actual functionality issues please raise an issue in the **issues** tab. Otherwise; additional help can be found by subscribing through [my twitch page](https://www.twitch.tv/stuyksoft/) and then joining the [Discord Group](https://discord.gg/gVfJkcs)

## Installation

#### If you don't have NodeJS v12+; please go install it.

**Requirements:**

-   Basic Programming Fundamentals

-   Basic Problem Solving Fundementals

-   Linux (Ubuntu 18+ Preferred) or Windows 10+

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

-   [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

-   PostgresSQL **v10 to v11.5**

    -   PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD v12. IT WILL NOT WORK.

    -   [Installing Postgres on Ubuntu (Only Go to Step #3)](https://tecadmin.net/install-postgresql-server-on-ubuntu/)

### Postgres

#### Windows Postgres Setup

-   Run the .exe and follow the prompts.

-   Run pgAdmin

-   You will be prompted for a password. This is your database password.

-   After you need to create a database called `altv`.

-   Here's a very brief `streamable example` of that taking place.

[Here's how you do it!](https://streamable.com/oq73f)

-   **Note:** By default your username will be `postgres` and your password will be whatever you use to log in to pgAdmin4.

#### Linux Postgres Setup

-   [Follow these instructions up to step #3](https://tecadmin.net/install-postgresql-server-on-ubuntu/)

-   Type: `su - postgres`

-   Type: `psql`

-   Type: `CREATE DATABASE altv;`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE DATABASE` or something similar replied.

-   Type: `CREATE USER stuyk WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'abc123';`

-   If all is well you will see `CREATE ROLE` replied.

-   We now have a user called `stuyk` with a password of `abc123`. We need to assign to db.

-   Type: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE altv TO stuyk;`

-   If all is well you wil see `GRANT` replied.

-   Type: `\q` to exit.

-   Type: `sudo -u root`

-   This will bring you back to your root account.

-   Now follow the rest of the steps below.

---

### Docker (Optional)

#### Installation using Docker

If you **do not know what docker is.** Please do not proceed any further.

OpenRP includes support for building and running the alt:V and PostgreSQL server using Docker. Included is a docker-compose.yml which contains many variables that you will need to edit. Any changes you make will require you to rebuild the altv-openrp container.

To build new containers, first edit the docker-compose.yml file and fill in all the details for the altv server and discord information, and then build with docker-compose. Note: You must agree with OpenRP terms of service by passing TOS_AGREE=true as a build argument.

```
docker-compose build --build-arg TOS_AGREE=true
```

To run the containers:

```
docker-compose up
```

Please see Docker and Docker-Compose documentation for more options.
